	<h1>Analysis of Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a computational measure that describes the amount of time an 
        algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. Understanding 
        this concept is vital for developing an efficient codebase, as it allows 
        developers to predict performance bottlenecks before they occur in production 
        environments.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space required by an 
        algorithm during its execution. For example, an algorithm that creates a new 
        list proportional to the input size is said to have a linear of O(n).
